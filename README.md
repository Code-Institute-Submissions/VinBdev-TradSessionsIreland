### User Centric Front End Development Project

## Trad Sessions Ireland

### A place for musicians to gather and collaborate
This is a detailed website implemented with the intention of growing social awareness of the music group as well as encouraging up and coming Irish musicians to become interested in playing and celebrating Irish music. Thw website is built so that young uders may easily navigate through the Home, Instruments and Contact page, allowing younger/ older users to quickly access relevant inforamtion or contact and join the group.

It should be noted that most people lose interest in Irish music due to lack of information about different instruments and how quickly we can learn each ones soe the second page on this site shall explain the top 10 instrument used in Irish music and there difficulty ranges to indicate the progression timeline.

The homepage will outline some group information along with a hero image and meet up times for the groups upcoming sessions.

#### User Stories:

#####  Jake Jerson
Jake Jerson is a 12 year old who is a massive fan of the Dubliners. When interested in learning how to play some of his favourite songs he was struggling to find an instrument that suited him.
  
#####  Gerald Oldman

Gerald is a 65 year old experienced Irish musician who has just moved back to Leinster from a rural area in Connaught. Gerald has played for 50+ years and with this wealth of experience can also play several instruments and is now looking for a new music group to play with.


### UX Design Stages

#### Strategy

My goal for this design was to allow ease of access to information as well as allowing all types of users to get information about upcoming music session as well as group information.

#### Scope

For users of the site I wanted to allow easy naviagtion across the 3 page structure. This is to enable new memebers of the group to bring new instrumetns and bring a different sound to the group. This will also contain contqact forms and a jumbotron to highlight when the next trad session will be.

#### Structure

The informational design will be very simple and eyecatching, as this page will have boith young and old users, I want to appeal to the general audeince. The homepage will have a short about section explaining how and why the group was founded, this will also encourage new memeber to join.


#### Skeleton

The navigation bar shall allow easy access to any page as well as clear instructions for the non-technical visitors to the site. Each page has a clear descrptive title as I wanted any user to have a clear and easy way to either sign up to become a member or to get the information they need to go to an event without having to sign up in case they are not tech savy.


#### Surface

My aim for this design was to use primary black and white as the primary onstrasting colors to indicate levels of importance to the various sections (navigation bar/ about section/ jumbotron/ contact form and list of images and descritopsn of instruments). This is to give a professional, sleak yet old fashioned feel to the site as the group does play old traditional music.

### Wireframe Mock ups:
* Home 
* Instruments 
* Contact 



### Features

#### Home Page

Initially there will be a consitant navigation bar across all 3 pages allowing access to Home, instruments and Contact page.

There will be a main hero image initially with some small animation to bring the image to life.

This will also have a call out linking to sign up page with information on the next music session. 

Below that I will have an about section explaining why and where the group originated from along with its current mission statement.

And finally a footer with relevant links to various social media pages of the group.

#### Instruments Page

This will contain a list of intruments and images of those intruments, Thedesriptions will describe what the instrument is, what music it can be used for and a progress bar indicating how long it will take to go from beginner to intermediate and advanced.

#### Contacts Page

At the top there will be a jumbotron cvcontaining hte groups nxt meet up time and locatino as well as highlighting to register to beocme  a member of the group.

### Technologies
1. HTML
2. 2. CSS
3. 3. Bootstrap (4.2.1)


### Testing



### Deployment

### Credits
##### The Full Stack programme lessons on UX deisgn and Bootstrap.
I reviewed the previous lessons of the course while typing out the core HTML and CSS structure of this project. I then used the Bootstrap framework to enable to site responsiveness for mobile/tablet and desktop users.
##### Youtube tutorials on Bootstrap url(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPmwdshCMw)
This was a great resource provided by my mentor on the Full Stack programme.
##### Stack Overflow - 
This was my first time using Stackoverflow as a resource for resolving my coding problems. The issue I cam across here was getting my navigation abr to hover over the hero image.

#### Content

All content in the about me section was written about my father/ family and based on personal experiences.

Welcome VinBdev,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
